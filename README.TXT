2. The value returned after I printed a ticket was a zero since the amount I put in was just enough to print a single ticket.
3.The extra money stays in the machine and allows me to use it on my next ticket. If I have to little money, the ticket doesn't print.
5.The ticket value changes when it is printed.
6.Public class TicketMachine(Inner part omitted)
7.Changing the name from Public class to Class pubic makes it so that it doesn't work anymore.
8.Removing Public doesn't affect it and everything will work as normal.
9.Removing the word Class makes it fail and won't work unlike taking out Public.
